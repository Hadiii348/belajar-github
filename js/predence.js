As in traditional mathematics, multiplication is done first:

let x = 100 + 50 * 3;
When using parentheses, operations inside the parentheses are computed first:

let x = (100 + 50) * 3;
Operations with the same precedence (like * and /) are computed from left to right:

let x = 100 / 50 * 3;
Operator Precedence Values
Expressions in parentheses are computed before the rest of the expression
Function are executed before the result is used in the rest of the expression
